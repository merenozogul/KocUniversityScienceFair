# KocUniversityScienceFair

This project is designed to work on the robot Furhat. I designed
this project for the Science Fair in my University. It includes the
followings:
-Makes a joke when asked.
-Can play tic-tac-toe with 2 difficulty modes.
-Can guess the number chosen by the user by using binary search,
and give the user the background information about how it works.
-Can give a quiz about Koç University and AI.
