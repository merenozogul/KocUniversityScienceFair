# KocUniversityScienceFair

This project is designed to work with the robot Furhat. I developed this project for the Science Fair at my university.
It includes the following features:
	-Makes a joke when asked.
	-Can play tic-tac-toe with 2 difficulty modes.\n
	-Can guess the number chosen by the user by using binary search,
and give the user the background information about how it works.
	-Can give a quiz about Koç University and AI.
